# **Understanding Client vs. Server in Google Earth Engine (GEE)**
**This repository provides an overview and code examples illustrating the differences between client-side and server-side processing in Google Earth Engine (GEE).**

When working with Google Earth Engine, it's essential to understand the distinction between client-side and server-side processing:

**Client-Side Processing:**

>  Refers to computations performed within the user's web browser or local environment. Client-side processing is 
typically used for tasks such as visualization, user interaction, and small-scale data manipulation.



**Server-Side Processing:**  

>Refers to computations performed on Google's servers. Server-side processing is utilized for large-scale data analysis, processing massive datasets, and complex geospatial algorithms.


Some examples of applications are shown below:

# **Bangladesh Administrative Boundary Analysis with Google Earth Engine (GEE)**

**This part of the repository is about downloading administrative boundary data of Bangladesh, uploading Upazila boundary shapefiles to Google Earth Engine (GEE), and filtering specific Upazila for analysis.**



1.   Downloading Administrative Boundary Data: Obtained administrative boundary data of Bangladesh from a reliable source in google.



2.   Uploading Upazila Boundary Shapefile to GEE: Uploaded Upazila boundary shapefiles to GEE's asset tab for further analysis.


3. Filtering Upazila: Filtered "Fatikchhari" Upazila for further analysis.
4.  Perimeter,area of Upazila: Printed the perimeter and area of Fatikchhari.


5. Visualize the filtered Upazila: Showed Fatikchhari upazila on the map.
